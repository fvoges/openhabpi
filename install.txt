- Get a (at least) 2GB SD Card with the Raspberry PI, best to choose compatible class 10
- Download Hexxeh's Raspbian from http://www.raspbian.org/HexxehImages (Direct: http://distribution.hexxeh.net/raspbian/raspbian-r3.zip)
- Write Image to SD using Win32 Disk Imager just like official Image (Tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdSB1GKQIdU)

apt-get -y install mercurial file
hg clone https://hlw31.de@code.google.com/p/openhabpi/
cd openhabpi
sh raspian_firstboot.sh
sh install.sh
- Wait until connection closes because RPI reboots.
- Wait 5 minutes then try http://openhab:8080/openhab.app?sitemap=demo to open the demo right from your RPI

Info: Choose install.sh for stable build, install_daily.sh for bleeding edge daily build
If you dare to run the install-script a second time, please do at least an "hg update" before.
